# Final-Game-
My final game for cs 120

Project goals:
To get each basic function working
Player and enemy projectiles 
Player and enemy sprite movement 
Health working properly
Games ends and starts correctly
Labels work as designed

Technologies Needed:
Pygame, random imports

Resources: 
Background img - istockphotos.com
Burger, bullet art - opengameart.org
audio - jsfxr
The rest is original art from me 

During the process:
- couple of small mistakes during making the introscene 
- reffered back to previous game code to compare
- fixed the current problem
- Working through the gameplay was easy to insert the images, sound, and timer
- Scrapped the jump function too many errors not enough time (my fault for that part)
- had a couple issues with the bullets functions
- figured out i left them inside the loop with each other so they wouldn't function right
- added on the Game over screen after pretty simple just made a new window that functions like the intro screen
- had some time and added labels with lives on them

What i wanna improve on:
 - double checking my code left a lot of silly little mistakes that made me think there were big problems when it was soemthing misspelled
 - i wanna get a little faster with it took too much time messing with small things not focusing on the big chunks of it
 - Quality: obviously we didnt spend months on this and dont have a team of developers, but i would like to be able to put something a lot more refined out there

I strayed very little from my original plan really was just jumping and then the addition of power ups

Stayed on track by working on one feature of the window i was working on at a time making sure they worked properly before i moved to the next function
