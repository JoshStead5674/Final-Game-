# Final-Game-
My final game for cs 120

Project goals:
To get each basic function working
Player and enemy projectiles 
Player and enemy sprite movement 
Health working properly
Games ends and starts correctly
Labels work as designed

Technologies Needed:
Pygame, random imports

Resources: 
Background img - istockphotos.com
Burger, bullet art - opengameart.org
audio - jsfxr
The rest is original art from me 

During the process:
couple of small mistakes during making the introscene 
reffered back to previous game code to compare
fixed the current problem
Working through the gameplay was easy to insert the images, sound, and timer
Had to look at notes and a few videos to see ways to make the player jump
